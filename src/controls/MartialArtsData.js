                    Chun Kuk Do was founded by Chuck Norris, and was originally based on Norris' Tang Soo Do training in Korea while he was in the military. During his competitive fighting career, Norris began to evolve the style to make it more effective and well-rounded by studying other systems such as Shōtōkan, Gōjū-ryū, Shitō-ryū, American Kenpo, Enshinkaikan, Kyokushin, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Arnis, Tae Kwon Do, Tang Soo Do and Hapkido. Chun Kuk Do now emphasizes self defense, competition, weapons, grappling, and fitness, among other things.[120] Each summer the United Fighting Arts Federation (UFAF) holds a training conference and the Chun Kuk Do world championship tournament in Las Vegas, Nevada.[121]

                    Chun Kuk Do includes a code of honor and rules to live by. These rules are from Norris' personal code. They are:[122]

                    <li>I will continually work at developing love, happiness and loyalty in my family.</li>
                    <li>I will look for the good in all people and make them feel worthwhile.</li>
                    <li>If I have nothing good to say about a person, I will say nothing.</li>
                    <li>I will always be as enthusiastic about the success of others as I am about my own.</li>
                    <li>I will maintain an attitude of open-mindedness.</li>
                    <li>I will maintain respect for those in authority and demonstrate this respect at all times.</li>
                    <li>I will always remain loyal to my God, my country, family and my friends.</li>
                    <li>I will remain highly goal-oriented throughout my life because that positive attitude helps my family, my country and myself.</li>

                    Like most traditional martial arts, Chun Kuk Do includes the practice of forms (Korean hyung and Japanese kata). The majority of the system's forms are adapted from Korean Tang Soo Do, and Taekwondo, Japanese Shitō-ryū, Shotokan Karate, Goju-ryu Karate, Judo, Brazilian Jiu-jitsu, American Kenpo and Kyokushinkai. It includes two organization-specific introductory forms, two organization-specific empty-hand forms, and one organization-specific weapon form (UFAF Nunchuk form, UFAF Bo form, UFAF Sai forms).[citation needed]
